## Installation

You can install pong directly from your terminal by using this git repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/brady-w-edwards/pong.git
$ cd pong
```

To run, you will need to install pygame. I recommend creating a virtual environment and installing:

```
$ python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install pygame
```

OR

You can find the pygame installation instructions here:

## How to Play

From your terminal, enter the directory where you installed the files.

```
$ cd ~/Desktop/myworkspace/pong
```

Run the 'main.py' file.

```
$ python3 main.py
```

Below is a table of the keyboard commands used when playing. Currently the game starts immediately when running the 'main.py' file.
